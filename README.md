# VikingWorkout

### Quick Rundown

I started developing this app to get some experience with React Native, I had used react very little before this. The colour scheme and name came from my favourite American Football team, the Minnesota Vikings. I didn't spend much time designing the app, which caused a few issues after a while.

### TODO:
* Showing past workout information
* Formatting set up workouts for display
* Timer can have some odd behaviour
